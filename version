1.0.12
 - added method for reservation to send selected date to server (still missing full responsive server method).


1.0.11
 - removed unnecessary files from other project.


1.0.10
Major bugs :
 - reservation.jsp not work as intended (need to implement method for adding new reservation, displaying already booked dates, transfer model from MVC to js).

To change :
 - add login / register module to project (Spring security).
 - add validation on server side for reservations.
 - site frontend style.
 - admin panel (missing few options).
